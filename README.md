# Ethernet: TCP server

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a secure TCP server with XMC7000 MCU. 

In this example, the TCP server establishes a connection with a TCP client. Once the connection is established successfully, the server allows the user to send a LED ON/OFF command to the TCP client; the client responds by sending an acknowledgement message to the server.

This example uses the Ethernet Core FreeRTOS lwIP mbedtls library. This library enables Ethernet-based application development by bundling together other libraries such as FreeRTOS, lwIP TCP/IP stack, Mbed TLS, and Secure sockets. The Secure sockets library provides an easy-to-use API by abstracting the network stack (lwIP) and the security stack (Mbed TLS).

## Using the code example


### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b. Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[Ethernet: TCP server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ethernet-tcp-server)" application with the desired name "EthernetTCPServer" configured for the *KIT_XMC72_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC72_EVK --app-id mtb-example-ethernet-tcp-server --user-app-name EthernetTCPserver --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Connect one LAN cable from the target board (server) to the router and another LAN cable from your PC (client) to the router.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

   **Figure 1. TCP server before establishing Ethernet connection**
  
   ![](images/tcp-server-pre-connection.png)

5. Make a note of the IP address assigned to the kit (server) as shown in **Figure 1**.
 
6. Open the *tcp_client.py* script located in the project directory in a text editor and update the IP address with the IP address assigned to your kit (server) (as shown in **Step 5**).

    For example, if the IP address assigned to your kit is `192.168.1.8`, update the following line in the *tcp_client.py* script:

    ```
    DEFAULT_IP   = '192.168.1.8'
    ```

7. From the project directory, open a command shell and run the Python TCP client (*tcp_client.py*). In the command shell opened in the project directory, type in the following command:

    ```
      python tcp_client.py
    ```
    
   > **Note:** Ensure that the firewall settings of your PC allow Python access to communicate with the TCP server. For more details on enabling Python access, see this [community thread](https://community.infineon.com/t5/ModusToolbox-General/CE229112-Enable-Python-access-to-your-WiFi/td-p/214654).

8. Press the user button (CYBSP_USER_BTN) to send the LED ON/OFF command to the Python TCP client. Each user button press will issue the LED ON or LED OFF commands alternately. The client in turn sends an acknowledgment message back to the server. **Figure 2** and **Figure 3** show the TCP server and TCP client outputs respectively.

   **Figure 3. TCP client output**

   ![](images/tcp-client-output.png)


   > **Note:** 

   - The code example has been tested in a local LAN setup and in a simple private network, such as a home network with VPN disabled. To test it in a complex network, such as an enterprise network, contact your IT department.
   - Ensure that the port used for communication on your PC is an active port. If not, open the firewall port. To display all the blocked and active ports configured in the firewall on the PC, open the command prompt (cmd for Windows) and enter the following command:

     ```
     netsh firewall show state
     ```


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.

## Design and implementation

This example executes an RTOS task: TCP server task.

The XMC7000 MCU is configured as a TCP server that establishes a connection with a TCP client. 
Once the connection is established successfully, the server allows the user to send an LED ON/OFF command to the TCP client; the client responds by sending an acknowledgement message to the server.
