# Ethernet: TCP server

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a TCP server with XMC7000. 

In this example, the TCP server establishes a connection with a TCP client. Once the connection completes successfully, the server allows the user to send LED ON/OFF command to the TCP client, and the client responds by sending an acknowledgment message to the server.
 
This example uses the Ethernet Core FreeRTOS lwIP mbedtls library of the SDK. This library enables application development based on Ethernet by bundling together various other libraries - FreeRTOS, lwIP TCP/IP stack, Mbed TLS, and secure sockets. The secure sockets library provides an easy-to-use API by abstracting the network stack (lwIP) and the security stack (mbed TLS).

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.


## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

Install a Python interpreter if you do not have one. This code example is tested with [Python 3.7.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/) and it is recommended to use a python 3 version.


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[Ethernet: TCP server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ethernet-tcp-server)" application with the desired name "MyTCPServer" configured for the *KIT_XMC72_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC72_EVK --app-id mtb-example-ethernet-tcp-server --user-app-name MyTCPServer --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br>

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and then import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation


1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Connect one LAN cable from the target board(server) to the router and another LAN cable from your PC(client) to the router.  

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=KIT_XMC72_EVK TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>
   
   **Figure 1. TCP server before establishing ethernet connection**
  
   ![](images/tcp-server-pre-connection.png)

5. Make a note of the IP address assigned to the kit(server), as shown in **Figure 1**.
 
6. Open the *tcp_client.py* script located in the  *{project directory}* in a text editor and update the IP address with the IP address assigned to your kit(server) (as noted in **Step 5**).

    For example, if the IP address assigned to your kit is `192.168.1.8`, update the following line in the *tcp_client.py* script:

    ```
    DEFAULT_IP   = '192.168.1.8'
    ```

7. From the project directory, open a command shell and run the Python TCP client (*tcp_client.py*). In the command shell opened in the project directory, type in the following command:

    ```
      python tcp_client.py
    ```
    
   **Note:** Ensure that the firewall settings of your PC allow access to the Python software so that it can communicate with the TCP server. For more details on enabling Python access, refer to this [community thread](https://community.infineon.com/t5/ModusToolbox-General/CE229112-Enable-Python-access-to-your-WiFi/td-p/214654).

8. Press the user button (CYBSP_USER_BTN) to send the LED ON/OFF command to the Python TCP client. Each user button press will issue the LED ON or LED OFF commands alternately. The client, in turn, sends an acknowledgment message back to the server.

**Note:** 
- The code example has been tested in a local LAN setup and in a simple private network such as a home network with VPN disabled. To test it in a complex network such as an enterprise network, please contact your IT department.
- Check whether the port used for communication on your PC is an active port or not. If not, then you will have to open the firewall port. To display all the blocked and active ports configured in the firewall on PC, open command prompt(cmd for Windows) and enter the following command. 
```
netsh firewall show state
```


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


## Design and implementation

This example executes an RTOS task: TCP server task.
In this example, XMC7000 is configured as a TCP server that establishes a connection with a TCP client. Once the connection completes successfully, the server allows the user to send LED ON/OFF command to the TCP client; the client responds by sending an acknowledgment message to the server.
